# Analysis code and code list repository for the “Take up to eight tablets per day”: Incorporating free-text medication instructions into a transparent and reproducible process for preparing drug exposure data for pharmacoepidemiology


# Background 

This repository contains the R-code for data analysis and the fracture read code lists used to 
identify fracture. Since we are using CPRD data, we are unable to share the data here and the 
code may not be suitable for use as it is with out data. If you are keen to learn about **doseminer** or **drugprepr**, we recommend visiting the vignettes for both packages which can be found here
